# Gun-Violence-Data-Visualization
This interactive visualization project answers questions about worldwide gun violence and its prevalence in different demographics. 

This data set was chosen in light of harrowing news of a tick in gun violence across America, this data visualization will answer various questions that plague the mind of those living in the US. These questions are: 

 1. Is there less gun violence in countries with restrictive measures in place? 

 2. Is there a correlation between population size and the prevalence in gun violence? 
 
 3. Does the general population owning their own firearms affect the rise or fall of gun violence?
