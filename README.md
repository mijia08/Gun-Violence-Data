# Gun-Violence-Data-Visualization
This interactive visualization project answers questions about worldwide gun violence and its prevalence in different demographics. 

This data set was chosen in light of harrowing news of a tick in gun violence across America, this data visualization will answer various questions that plague the mind of those living in the US. These questions are: 

Is there less gun violence in countries with restrictive measures in place? 

Is there a correlation between less restrictive measures and the prevalence in gun violence? 
 
Since the 2020 global pandemic, the world has seen soaring costs in motor vehicles across the world. Some have been unlucky
enough to have found themselves needing to buy an automobile in this market, since fear of missing out and thinking that the prices
would rise instead of fall. Since this problem is universal to all, I wanted to address this by taking samples of pre-pandemic, pandemic 
and post-pandemic to better predict the next behavior of car prices. I propose building a vizualization that draws out clear correlation 
between market, car and pricing to address market behavior. 
In light of harrowing news in the US, I wanted to shed light on the evergrowing issue of gun violence. There has been heavy debate between pro-gun and anti-gun Americans due to the rising mass
shootings that are occurring in mostly schools where our children learn. This is an issue that needs to be addressed through data and hard facts, which is why I am choosing to visualize data from various areas that have gun laws and other affecting demographics. 

I will be visualizing a data set of approximately 135 gun provision categories and their provision level, 142 mass shootings since 1982, location,	date,	summary,	fatalities,	injured	,total_victims,	location.1,	age_of_shooter,	prior_signs_mental_health_issues,	mental_health_details,	weapons_obtained_legally,	where_obtained,	weapon_type	weapon_details,	race,	gender	,latitude,	longitude,	type,	year,	quarter, half,	month_name,	day_of_week	,age_group,	decade,	name,	current_age	and description. Using this data, I will create a new category answering the question of whether gun provisions help cease mass shootings called prob_violence.

Lawmakers want to use data in order to [analyze] the decision of restricting access to guns to a broader audience and will use this data by looking at the factors that lead to the probability created. They will be able to [identify] key factors in higher probabiility of mass shootings by [comparing] different categories and [understanding] why their correlation makes sense in this aspect. They will be able to search per area, density, gun restrictions level, and mass shooting prevalence. Lawmakers believe that areas with denser population and restrictive gun laws have more mass shootings.

Throughout my data visualization process, it was easy to see what figures most affected the question athand. This allowed me to create a couple of charts that highlight where the violence is and the gun laws in that area. I was able to answer my question that, yes, lesser gun restrictions has lead to more gun violence. There is a highly independent correlation between restrictive measures and the prevalence of gun violence. Restrictive measures can exist with no gun violence as an attribute, and gun violence exists more often than not when more restrictive measures do not exist.
